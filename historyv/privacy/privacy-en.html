  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> August 4, 2025</p>

  <p>Aliaksei Sabaleuski ("we", "our", or "us") built the <strong>History V</strong> app as a free app. This service is provided at no cost and is intended for use as is.</p>

  <p>This page is used to inform visitors regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information if anyone decides to use the app.</p>

  <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
  <p><strong>History V</strong> does not collect any personally identifiable information such as name, email address, or user account data.</p>

  <h2>AdMob and Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The app uses Google AdMob to display non-personalized banner ads. While we do not request access to the device's advertising ID or track users across apps, AdMob may still collect limited data such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Device information (e.g., model, OS version)</li>
    <li>IP address (used to infer region or language)</li>
    <li>Ad performance metrics (e.g., impressions, clicks)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This data is used to ensure the proper functioning and reporting of ads, not for user profiling. No personalized ads are shown.</p>

  <p>For more information, please refer to <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites" target="_blank">Google’s Privacy Policy for Partner Sites</a>.</p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>This app is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children.</p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>We value your trust in using our app. While no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect it.</p>

  <h2>Your Rights</h2>
  <p>If you are a resident of the European Union or California, you may have additional rights under GDPR or CCPA. Since we do not collect or store personal data, requests for data access or deletion do not apply.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy from time to time. We encourage you to review this page periodically for any changes. Changes are effective immediately after they are posted.</p>
